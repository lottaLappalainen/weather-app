# React Weather Application

A canon event in the programming journey: choosing weather application as an optional project

Done with React and css. Were I to do this project today, I would rather use tailwind css etc, though the project helped with mastering flexbox.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:


### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
   VITE_TIMEZONE_API_KEY=your_timezone_api_key
   ```

   Replace `your_openweather_api_key` and `your_timezone_api_key` with your actual API keys from https://openweathermap.org/api and https://timezonedb.com/api

### Running the Application

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5174` (or the port specified in your terminal) to view the application.
